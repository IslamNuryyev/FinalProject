## Project information: 
The project features a linear game of Battleship where two players each assign a position, from 0 to 9, for their ships. The positions are represented by circles and each player tries to guess the location of their opponent's ship. A wrong guess turns the circle red and a correct one turns it green. The game concludes with a player winning and the title of the window displaying a message specifying the winner.
